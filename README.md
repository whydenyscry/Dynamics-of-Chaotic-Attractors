# Dynamics of Chaotic Attractors

This is a sequel to my repository [Dynamics of Nonlinear Attractors](https://github.com/whydenyscry/Dynamics-of-Nonlinear-Attractors) on which I have reached the limit for using mathematical expressions. This repository will also only consider 3D attractors, but I still plan to create a separate repository for hyperchaotic attractors.

The plots are also available on Pinterest and Behance:
